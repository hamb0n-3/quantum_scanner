# Quantum Scanner - Operational Security Guide

This document outlines the operational security (OpSec) improvements made to Quantum Scanner and best practices for red team operations.

## Enhanced Security Features

### 1. Build Process Security
- Binary is stripped to remove debug symbols that could reveal information
- Ultra-minimal UPX compression enabled by default to produce the smallest possible binary size and obfuscate code patterns
- Secure clean-up of build artifacts to prevent forensic recovery

### 2. Runtime Security
- DNS requests routed through Tor when available
- Randomized packet timing to evade pattern recognition
- Automatic enabling of evasion techniques
- Secure temporary logging to memory-backed locations
- Automatic secure deletion of logs
